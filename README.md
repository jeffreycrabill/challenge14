# challenge14
The purpose of this project is use machine learning to build the optimal neural network for predicting whether or not a start up will become profitable.

## Technologies
This project was created with on JupyterLab with python v3.7.13.  It also uses the packages pandas, sklearn and hvPlot

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool.

[hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/index.html)  high-level API for data exploration and visualization

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a simple and efficient machine learning tool for predictive data analysis.
